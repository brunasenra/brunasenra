# Hello! I'm Bruna Senra Faria. 

I graduated in Physics from the Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), in 2019. Currently work at the Olimpíada Brasileira de Astronomia e Astronáutica (OBA), where I coordinate a project that serves around 30 thousand people per year, manage a team of 20 interns and train new teams and teach courses and lectures in the area. I have 9 years of experience with data collection and processing, budget projects, accountability etc.

I have experience with data analysis and processing applied in experimental physics, in the area of stellar astrophysics, and wrote my monograph with the theme: orbital analysis of spectroscopic binary star systems, where I used Python programming tools and time series, to define orbital parameters.

I met and started working with Python and developed a great interest in the area of data analysis. I took courses and identified myself with data science. I am fascinated by the power of machine learning tools, I am creative, proactive, dedicated and I enjoy working as a team. I learned a lot and I’m still learning with every project that I collaborate and every people that I know.

# Projects

## Data Science Projects:

### [Store Sales Prediction](https://github.com/brunasenra/Store_Sales_Prediction-Rossmann)

Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. The delivered solution was a Telegram bot. The user just needed to send the store number and the bot would answer the predicted total sales that the store would made by the end of the next six weeks.

### [Cardiovascular Disease Detection](https://github.com/brunasenra/Cardiovascular-Disease-Detection)

The diagnosis of Cadio Catch Diseases company need to create a tool that increases the accuracy of the diagnosis and that this accuracy is stable for all diagnoses.
In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model able to detect disease in early stages with 73.36% accuracy over 70k patience.
The performance of this model would increase revenue of R$65 millions according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.

### [California Crime Compendium](https://github.com/brunasenra/California-Crime-Compendium)

Through data analysis, the locations with the highest crime rate in the 4 groups are presented: agencies, universities, cities and countys.

Project repo: https://github.com/brunasenra/California-Crime-Compendium

<br>
    
### [House Sales Company - IN PRODUCTION](https://github.com/brunasenra/House-Sales)

Processing data for the purchase and sale of properties with the purpose of maximizing revenue by taking advantage of the best opportunities in the real estate market. At the end of the analysis, the project aims to understand the relationship between price and property attributes and present an interactive dashboard in Streamlit as an output.
